\textbf{First Order Differential Equations}

{\aufgabe} Suppose that an airplane departs from the point $(a,0)$
located due east of its intended destination---an airport located at
the origin $(0,0)$. The plane travels with constant speed $v_{0}$
relative to the wind, which is blowing due north with constant speed
$w$. As indicated in the diagram, we assume that the plane's pilot
maintains its heading directly toward the origin.

Find $\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{dy/dt}{dx/dt}$ in terms of $x$ and $y$,
solve the differential equation and determine what happens with
$\lim_{x\rightarrow{}0^{+}}f(x)$ depending on whether $w<v_{0}$,
$w=v_{0}$, or $w>v_{0}$.
