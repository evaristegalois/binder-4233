\textbf{First Order and Reducible Second Order Differential Equations}

{\aufgabe} Find the general solutions for the following two
differential equations. You may have to assume that $x,y,y'$ are
positive.
% EPC 69:48--49
\begin{align*}
  x^{2}y''+3xy'&=2\\
  yy''+\left(y'\right)^{2}&=yy'\\
\end{align*}

{\aufgabe} Suppose that an airplane departs from the point $(a,0)$
located due east of its intended destination---an airport located at
the origin $(0,0)$. The plane travels with constant speed $v_{0}$
relative to the wind, which is blowing due north with constant speed
$w$. As indicated in the diagram, we assume that the plane's pilot
maintains its heading directly toward the origin.

Find $\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{dy/dt}{dx/dt}$ in terms of $x$ and $y$,
solve the differential equation and determine what happens with
$\lim_{x\rightarrow{}0^{+}}f(x)$ depending on whether $w<v_{0}$,
$w=v_{0}$, or $w>v_{0}$.

\newpage

{\aufgabe} Each of the following differential equations is of two
different types---separable, linear, homogeneous, Bernoulli, exact,
etc. Hence, derive general solutions for each of these equations in
two different ways; then reconcile your results.
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item $\displaystyle \frac{dy}{dx}=3(y+7)x^{2}$
\item $\displaystyle \frac{dy}{dx}=xy^{3}-xy$
\item $\displaystyle \frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{3x^{2}+2y^{2}}{4xy}$
\item $\displaystyle \frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{x+3y}{y-3x}$
\item $\displaystyle \frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{2xy+2x}{x^{2}+1}$
\item $\displaystyle \frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{\sqrt{y}-y}{\tan{}x}$
\end{enumerate}

{\aufgabe} Even before taking into account the effect of air
resistance, the velocity of a falling hailstone can be substantially
slowed by other factors. Consider, for instance, a spherical hailstone
falling through a uniform mist under the influence of gravity alone.
As the hailstone falls through the fog, it collects moisture to itself
from the mist, gaining mass in a manner that affects its velocity. In
a coordinate system in which the positive direction is upward, the
hailstone's vertical displacement $y$ is then governed by a non-linear
second-order differential equation:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:qwfoltta}
  \frac{d^{2}y}{dt^{2}}=-g-\frac{3}{y}\left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right)^{2}\notag
\end{equation}
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item Use appropriate substitution methods to determine a general
  solution for $v(y)$, the vertical
velocity $v$ as a function of vertical displacement $y$.
\item Apply the initial condition $v=0$ at $y=0$ to determine a particular solution for $v(y)$. For
this particular solution, find $y(t)$ using the fact that $v=dy/dt$.
\item What is the acceleration (expressed as a function of time $t$) experienced by the hailstone for
the particular solution found above?
\end{enumerate}
