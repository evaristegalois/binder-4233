\textbf{Hypothesis Testing}

%% 7 %%
{\aufgabe} In a test of the effectiveness of garlic for lowering
cholesterol, 49 subjects were treated with raw garlic. Cholesterol
levels were measured before and after the treatment. The changes
(before minus after) in their levels of LDL cholesterol (in mg/dL)
have a mean of 0.4 and a standard deviation of 21.0. Test the claim
($\alpha=0.05$) that with garlic treatment, the mean change in LDL
cholesterol is greater than 0. What do the results suggest about the
effectiveness of the garlic treatment?

%% 8 %%
{\aufgabe} A simple random sample of 40 men's pulse rate results in a
standard deviation of 10.3 beats per minute. The normal range of pulse
rates of adults is typically given as 60 to 100 beats per minute. If
the range rule of thumb is applied to that normal range, the result is
a standard deviation of 10 beats per minute. Use the sample results
with a 0.05 significance level to test the claim that pulse rates of
men have a standard deviation equal to 10 beats per minute. Assume
that the population is normally distributed.

%% 5 %%
{\aufgabe} The table below lists ages of actresses when they won
Oscars, and the summary statistics are $n=82,\bar{x}=35.9,s=11.1$ with years
being the unit. Use a 0.01 significance level to test the claim that
the mean age of actresses when they win Oscars is 33 years.

{\aufgabe} The weights (lb) of discarded plastic from a sample of
households is listed on the next slide, and the summary statistics are
$n=62,\bar{x}=1.911,s=1.065$. Use a 0.05 significance level to test
the claim that the mean weight of discarded plastic from the
population of households is greater than 1.800 lb.

%% 13 %%
{\aufgabe} One classic application of correlation involves the
association between the temperature and the number of times a cricket
chirps in a minute. Listed below are the numbers of chirps in one
minute and the corresponding temperatures in $^{\circ}$F (based on
data from ``The Song of Insects'' by George W. Pierce, Harvard
University Press). Is there sufficient evidence to conclude that there
is a linear correlation between the number of chirps in one minute and
the temperature?

{\aufgabe} In ``The Overtime Rule in the National Football League:
Fair or Unfair?'' the authors report that among 414 football games won
in overtime, 235 were won by the team that won the coin toss at the
beginning of overtime. Using a 0.05 significance level, test the claim
that the coin toss is fair in the sense that neither team has an
advantage by winning it.

%% 9 %%
{\aufgabe} A simple random sample of 25 filtered 100-mm cigarettes is
obtained, and the tar content of each cigarette is measured. The
sample has a standard deviation of 3.7 mg (see the data below). Use a
0.05 significance level to test the claim that the tar content of
filtered 100-mm cigarettes has a standard deviation different from 3.2
mg, which is the standard deviation for unfiltered king-size
cigarettes. Assume that the population is normally distributed.

{\aufgabe} Voting records show that 61\% of eligible voters actually
did vote in a recent presidential election. In a survey of 1002
people, 70\% said that they voted in that election (based on data from
ICR Research Group). Use the survey results to test the claim that the
percentage of all voters who say that they voted is equal to 61\%.
What do the results suggest?

{\aufgabe} Listed below are systolic blood pressure measurements (in
mm Hg) obtained from the same woman (based on data from ``Consistency
of Blood Pressure Differences Between the Left and Right Arms,'' by
Eguchi et al., Archives of Internal Medicine, Vol.\ 167). Is there
sufficient evidence to conclude that there is a linear correlation
between right and left arm systolic blood pressure measurements?

{\aufgabe} Costs listed below are repair costs (in dollars) for cars
crashed at 6 mi/h in full-front crash tests and the same cars crashed
at 6 mi/h in full-rear crash tests (based on data from the Insurance
Institute for Highway Safety). The cars are the Toyota Camry, Mazda 6,
Volvo S40, Saturn Aura, Subaru Legacy, Hyundai Sonata, and Honda
Accord. Is there sufficient evidence to conclude that there is a
linear correlation between the repair costs from full-front crashes
and full-rear crashes?

{\aufgabe} Consider the data in the table below. These are the results
for two successive term tests (the names are randomly made up by a
computer program, but the grades are real). Answer the following
questions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Is there a linear correlation between the first and the second
  term test? Answer the question for a significance level of
  $\alpha=0.05$. If you were doing this problem with a significance
  level $\alpha=0.01$, what would be the decision and what type of
  error (type I or type II) would it make less likely compared to
  using the higher significance level?
\item What is the equation of the regression line?
  \newpage
\item If William Jones (again, fake name but real grade) had a score
  of $85$ on the first term test, what score is the point estimate for
  the second term test given the linear correlation? His true score
  for the second term test was $77$.
