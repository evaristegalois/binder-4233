  \frametitle{Example 1}

  Consider a system of two masses and two springs, with a given
  external force $f(t)$ acting on the right-hand mass $m_2$. We denote
  by $x(t)$ the displacement (to the right) of the mass $m_1$ from its
  static equilibrium position (when the system is motionless and in
  equilibrium and $f(t)=0$) and by $y(t)$ the displacement of the mass
  $m_2$ from its static position. Thus the two springs are neither
  stretched nor compressed when $x$ and $y$ are zero.

  The first spring is stretched or compressed by $x$ units and the
  second by $y$ units. We apply Newton's law of motion to the system,
  obtaining
  \begin{align*}
    m_1x''&=-k_1x+k_2(y-x) \\
    m_2y''&=-k_2(y-x)+f(t)
  \end{align*}
  of differential equations that the position functions $x(t)$ and
  $y(t)$ must satisfy. For instance, if $m_1=2,m_2=1,k_1=4,k_2=2$, and
  $f(t)=40\sin(3t)$ in appropriate physical units, then the system
  reduces to
  \begin{align*}
    2x''&=-6x+2y \\
    y''&=2x-2y+40\sin(3t)
  \end{align*}

  \frametitle{Example 2}

  Consider two connected brine tanks, where tank 1 contains $x(t)$
  pounds of salt in $100\,gal$ of brine and tank 2 contains $y(t)$
  pounds of salt in $200\,gal$ of brine. The brine in each tank is
  kept uniform by stirring, and brine is pumped from each tank to the
  other at the rates indicated. In addition, fresh water flows into
  tank 1 at $20\,gal/min$, and the brine in tank 2 flows out at
  $20\,gal/min$ (so the total volume of brine in the two tanks remains
  constant). The salt concentrations in the two tanks are $\frac{x}{100}$ pounds
  per gallon and $\frac{y}{200}$ pounds per gallon, respectively. When we
  compute the rates of change of the amount of salt in the two
  tanks, we therefore get the system of differential equations that
  $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ must satisfy:
  \begin{align*}
    20x'&=-6x+y \\
    20y'&=6x-3y
  \end{align*}

  Consider the electrical network shown in the diagram, where $I_1(t)$
  denotes the current in the indicated direction through the inductor
  $L$ and $I_2(t)$ denotes the current through the resistor $R_2$. The
  current through the resistor $R_1$ is $I=I_1-I_2$ in the direction
  indicates.
