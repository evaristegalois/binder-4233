\textbf{Higher Order Differential Equations}

% EPC 100:1
{\ubung} The acceleration of a Maserati is proportional to the
difference between $250\,km/h$ and the velocity of this sports car. If
this machine can accelerate from rest to $100\,km/h$ in $10\,s$, how long
will it take for the car to accelerate from rest to $200\,km/h$?

% EPC 100:10
{\ubung} A woman bails out of an airplane at an altitude of 10,000
feet, falls freely for $20\,s$, then opens her parachute. How long
will it take her to reach the ground? Assume linear air resistance
$\rho{}v\,ft/s^{2}$, taking $\rho=0.15$ without the parachute and
$\rho=1.5$ with the parachute.

% EPC 101:26
{\ubung} Suppose that you are stranded---your rocket engine has
failed---on an asteroid of diameter 3 miles, with density equal to
that of the earth with radius 3960 miles. If you have enough spring in
your legs to jump 4 feet straight up on earth while wearing your space
suit, can you blast off from this asteroid using leg power alone?

% EPC 103:4
The V-2 rocket that was used to attack London in World War II had an
initial mass of 12,850 kilograms, of which 68.5\% was fuel. This fuel
burned uniformly for 70 seconds with an exhaust velocity of $2\,km/s$.
Assume it encounters air resistance of $1.45\,N$ per $m/s$ of
velocity. Then find the velocity and altitude of the V-2 at burnout
under the assumption that it is launched vertically upward from rest
on the ground.

% EPC 159:25
Let $L$ be an operator with
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:ikeeajri}
  Ly=y''+py'+qy\notag
\end{equation}
Suppose that $y_{1}$ and $y_{2}$ are two functions such that
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:sjuyttkw}
  Ly_{1}=f(x)\mbox{ and }Ly_{2}=g(x)\notag
\end{equation}
Show that their sum $y=y_{1}+y_{2}$ satisfies the nonhomogeneous
equation
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:qhjsjent}
  Ly=f(x)+g(x)\notag
\end{equation}
