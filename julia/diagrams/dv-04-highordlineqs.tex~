  \frametitle{Logistic Modeling}
  You are familiar with uninhibited exponential growth (or decay). The
  formula is
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:xefohvai}
    A(t)=A(0)e^{kt}\notag
  \end{equation}
  where $k$ is the growth (or decay) constant. This formula solves the
  differential equation
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:ieyeisee}
    \frac{dA}{dt}=kA\notag
  \end{equation}
  However, much exponential growth is inhibited, for example by
  limited food supply or, in the case of a virus or a rumour, by a
  limited number of people to infect. In this case, the population is
  proportional both to the population and to the difference between
  the population and the carrying capacity $M$:
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:kiediete}
    \frac{dA}{dt}=kA(M-A)\notag
\end{equation}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{The Logistic Equation}
  A differential equation is called \alert{logistic} if it is of the
  form
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:ujiafiem}
    \frac{dP}{dt}=aP+bP^{2}\notag
  \end{equation}
  This is a separable differential equation which models bounded
  populations.

  {\ubung} The US population in 1800 was $5.308$ million and in 1900
  was $76.212$ million. The growth was approximately exponential and
  uninhibited. Calculate the average percentage population growth per
  year.

  \bigskip

  {\ubung} Between 1900 and 2000, an uninhibited exponential growth
  model no longer works for the US population. For example, the actual
  population in 2000 was $281.422$ million---compare this to a
  prediction from the last exercise. Let us model the US population
  between 1800 and 2000 using the logistic model instead. Use the 1800
  population from the last exercise and the 1850 population of
  $23.192$ million to find $a$ and $b$, and then predict the
  population in 2000. Compare your prediction to the actual population
  in 2000.

% EPC 82:10
  {\ubung} Suppose that the fish population $P(t)$ in a lake is
  attacked by a disease at time $t=0$, with the result that the fish
  cease to reproduce (so that the birth rate is $\beta=0$) and the
  death rate $\delta$ (deaths per week per fish) is thereafter
  proportional to $1/\sqrt{P}$. If there were initially $900$ fish in
  the lake and $441$ were left after six weeks, how long did it take
  all the fish in the lake to die?

% EPC 82:24 and oowobood.ipynb
  {\ubung} Suppose that a community contains 15,000 people who are
  susceptible to Michaud's syndrome, a contagious disease. At time $t=0$
  the number $N(t)$ of people who have developed Michaud's syndrome
  is 5,000 and is increasing at the rate of 500 per day. Assume that
  $N'(t)$ is proportional to the product of the numbers of those who
  have caught the disease and of those who have not. How long will it
  take for another 5,000 people to develop Michaud's syndrome?
\end{frame}

  \frametitle{Autonomous Differential Equations}
  An autonomous differential equation is of the form
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:vubadeeh}
    \frac{dx}{dt}=f(x)\notag
  \end{equation}
  $t$ does not appear explicitly on the RHS. Differential equations in
  physics are often of this form, as they are independent of when they
  are in effect (independent of $t$). Autonomous systems (multiple
  autonomous differential equations solved together) are closely
  related to dynamical systems.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Autonomous Differential Equations}
{\ubung} Consider a lake with fish in it. The fish population $x(t)$ can be
modelled by a logistic equation with a carrying capacity of $M=4$ (in
hundreds). Additionally, 300 fish are harvested from this lake per
year (evenly distributed over the year), so
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:meengahj}
  \frac{dx}{dt}=x(4-x)-3\notag
\end{equation}
Let the initial fish population be $x_{0}$. How many fish do you need
at least in the lake so the lake does not get fished out? This number
is called a \alert{critical point} of the autonomous differential
equation. It is \alert{unstable} because it acts like a ``spout.'' If
there are more fish, the fish population will grow to 400. If there
are fewer fish, the fish will go extinct. $x=4$ is also a critical
point, but it is \alert{stable} as it acts like a ``funnel.'' Some
critical points are semi-stable: stable from above and unstable from
below or vice versa.

  \frametitle{Air Resistance}
  Newton's second law tells us that $F=ma$. As a consequence, the
  velocity of an object under the influence of gravity (neglecting air
  resistance, for example) fulfills
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:viuwegee}
    m\frac{dv}{dt}=F_{G}\notag
  \end{equation}
  Near the surface of the Earth, $F_{G}=-mg$ with
  $g\approx{}9.8m/s^{2}$.

  \bigskip

  {\ubung} Suppose that a crossbow bolt is shot straight upward from
  the ground ($y_{0}=0$) with initial velocity $v_{0}=49m/s$.
  Calculate how far it will go before it returns to the ground. Also
  calculate the time it will hit the ground and with what velocity.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Air Resistance}
  Now we also want to take account of air resistance.
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:johnaeji}
    m\frac{dv}{dt}=F_{G}+F_{R}\notag
  \end{equation}
  Newton showed in his \emph{Principia Mathematica} that certain simple
  physical assumptions imply that $F_{R}$ is proportional to the square
  of the velocity:
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:oagujeif}
    F_{R}=kv^{2}\notag
\end{equation}
Empirical investigations indicate that the actual dependence of
air resistance on velocity can be quite complicated. For many
purposes it suffices to assume that
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:shaenesh}
  F_{R}=kv^{p}\notag
\end{equation}
where $1\leq{}p\leq{}2$ and the value of $k$ depends on the size and
shape of the body, as well as the density and viscosity of the air.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Air Resistance}
  Generally speaking, $p=1$ for relatively low speeds and $p=2$ for
  high speeds, whereas $1<p<2$ for intermediate speeds. How slow
  ``low speed'' and how fast ``high speed'' are depend on the same factors
  that determine the value of the coefficient $k$. Thus air resistance
  is a complicated physical phenomenon.

  \bigskip

  The simplifying assumption that $F_{R}$ is exactly of the form
  given here, with either $p=1$ or $p=2$, yields a tractable
  mathematical model that exhibits the most important qualitative
  features of motion with resistance.

% aephooxi
  {\ubung}We again consider a bolt shot straight upward with initial velocity
  $v_{0}=49m/s$ from a crossbow at ground level. Now we take air
  resistance into account, with $\rho=0.04$ ($\rho=k/m$). We ask how the
  resulting maximum height and time aloft compare with the values
  found in in the earlier exercise.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Air Resistance}
  If you use quadratic air resistance,
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:shuwisho}
    F_{R}=\pm{}kv^{2}\notag
  \end{equation}
  The choice of signs here depends on the direction of motion, which
  the force of resistance always opposes. You can rewrite
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:yaeghian}
    F_{R}=kv|v|\notag
  \end{equation}
  and distinguish the case when the object ascends and when it descends.

  {\ubung} A lunar lander is free-falling toward the moon, and at an
  altitude of $53$ kilometers above the lunar surface its downward
  velocity is measured at $1477\,km/h$. Its retrorockets, when fired
  in free space, provide a deceleration of $T=4\,m/s^{2}$. At what
  height above the lunar surface should the retrorockets be activated
  to ensure a soft touchdown ($v=0$ at impact)?

  difference between $250\,km/h$ and the velocity of this sports car.
  If this machine can accelerate from rest to $100\, km/h$ in $10$
  seconds, how long will it take for the car to accelerate from rest
  to $200\,km/h$?

  linear air resistance $\rho{}v\,ft/s^{2}$, taking $\rho=0.15$
  without the parachute and $\rho=1.5$ with the parachute.

  \frametitle{Euler's Method}
%
  It is the exception rather than the rule when a differential
  equation of the general form
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:olawaeve}
    \frac{dy}{dx}=f(x,y)\notag
\end{equation}
can be solved exactly and explicitly by elementary methods like those
discussed so far. For example, consider the simple equation
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:cohhahhi}
  \frac{dy}{dx}=e^{-x^{2}}\notag
\end{equation}
A solution of this equation is simply an antiderivative of
$e^{-x^{2}}$. It is known that every antiderivative of this function
is a nonelementary function: one that cannot be expressed as a finite
combination of the familiar functions of elementary calculus. Any
attempt to use our symbolic techniques to find an
explicit formula for a solution is therefore doomed to failure.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Euler's Method}
  Given the initial value problem
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:yaengaif}
    \frac{dy}{dx}=f(x,y)\qquad{}y(x_{0})=y_{0}\notag
  \end{equation}
  Euler's method with step size $h$ consists of applying the iterative
  formula
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:ugeadain}
    y_{n+1}=y_{n}+h\cdot{}f(x_{n},y_{n})\notag
\end{equation}

  \end{equation}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item first with step size $h=1$ on the interval $[0,5]$
  \item then with step size $h=0.2$ on the interval $[0,1]$
  \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Euler's Method}
%
  Note that sometimes things can go wrong for any of the numerical
  methods covered here. It is always a good idea to start with step
  size $h$, then reduce to $h/2, h/4, h/8$ and so on to see if there
  are any issues.

  \bigskip

  The error for Euler's method is of order $h$, which means that for a
  finite number of approximations $y_{1},{\ldots},y_{k}$ there exists
  a constant $C$ (which does not depend on $h$) such that
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:foutidai}
    |y_{n}-y(x_{n})|\leq{}Ch\mbox{ for all }n=1,{\ldots},k\notag

  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:ahfaetie}
    \frac{dy}{dx}=f(x,y)\qquad{}y(x_{0})=y_{0}\notag
  \end{equation}
  the improved Euler method with step size $h$ consists of applying the iterative
  formulas
  \begin{align*}
    \label{eq:tairaewi}
    k_{1}&=f(x_{n},y_{n}) \\
    u_{n+1}&=y_{n}+h\cdot{}k_{1} \\
    k_{2}&=f(x_{n+1},u_{n+1}) \\
    y_{n+1}&=y_{n}+\frac{h}{2}\left(k_{1}+k_{2}\right)\notag

  between $x=0$ and $x=1$ for various values of $h$.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{The Runge-Kutta Method}
The error for the improved Euler method is of order $h^{2}$ (rather
than $h$ for Euler's method). We can do even better with the
Runge-Kutta method ($h^{4}$). The idea is similar to Simpson's rule.
Recall that
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:dejeohaa}
  y(x_{n+1})-y(x_{n})\approx\frac{h}{6}\left(y'(x_{n})+4y'\left(x_{n}+\frac{h}{2}\right)+y'(x_{n+1})\right)\notag
\end{equation}
turn this into
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:oopeibah}
  y(x_{n+1})\approx{}y(x_{n})+\notag
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:sohceewi}
  \frac{h}{6}\left(y'(x_{n})+2y'\left(x_{n}+\frac{h}{2}\right)+2y'\left(x_{n}+\frac{h}{2}\right)+y'(x_{n+1})\right)\notag
\end{equation}

  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:shohyohz}

  the Runge-Kutta method with step size $h$ consists of applying the iterative

falling after five seconds have elapsed? After ten seconds? After 20
seconds?
