    "The velocity of the snowplow is inversely proportional to the height of the snow cover, which is directly proportional to the time. Therefore $$\\frac{dx}{dt}=k\\cdot\\frac{1}{t}$$ Consequently, $$x(t)=k\\ln{}t+C$$ We also know that $$\\begin{array}{rcl}x(T+3)-x(T+1)&=&2\\\\x(T+1)-x(T)&=&2\\end{array}$$ where $T$ is the number of hours after it started snowing and it is 7am at $T$. Solve this system for $T=1$ and $k=\\frac{1}{\\ln\\sqrt{2}}$ (units are miles and hours). Therefore, it started snowing at 6am."
