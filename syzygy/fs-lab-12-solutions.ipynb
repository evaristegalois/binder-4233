    "The New England Journal of Medicine published preliminary results of an ongoing trial with the antiviral drug remdesivir on April 10, 2020. Even though the sampling is imperfect, at the current state of research here is the best we can do: 7 out of 53 hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections died if treated with remdesivir (in North America, Europe, and Japan), compared to a group of 99 hospitalized cases treated with lopinavir at Jin Yin-Tan Hospital in Wuhan, China, 19 of which died. Assume the requirements for a hypothesis test are met and test the claim that remdesivir is more effective than lopinavir at a significance level of 0.1 (given the urgency of the situation, we cannot be picky with a high significance level). Use the $p$-value approach."
